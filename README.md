## See [YouTube video #194] in my channel https://youtube.com/ralphbacon  

We discussed the breadboard circuit in video #190 (https://youtu.be/wcRuVxXlEKw), but here we have the finished product, including the panelised PCB from JLCPCB together with some testing using a signal generator and an oscilloscope.

The 555 is the most popular integrated circuit ever manufactured. As of 2003, it was estimated that 1 billion units were manufactured every year. And we are using it this week in this timer watchdog that power recycles your Arduino (or other ÂµController of choice) if it hangs up.
